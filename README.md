This repository serves as a fork of GregoriousT's mod GregTech 2.

* [Official archive](https://gregtech.mechaenetia.com/1.4.6/)

## Building

    $ ./gradlew build

## Contributing

* If a method looks obviously decompiled, it can be a good idea to re-create it using the [2.76d source code backup](https://github.com/asiekierka/GregTech2/tree/8618899b29e0d1afa7cbb5ab3a554779949fa2d7) - many of the methods have not changed significantly between 2.76d and 2.90i (the decompiled version).

## License

> This Mod was made by me, Gregorius Techneticies (aka GregoriusT) and is licensed under the LGPL and Creative Commons 0 for the most Parts (except Logos), so share it whereever you want, nobody is going to stop you. ;)
> Some older GregTech Sourcecode does not exist anymore, so I cannot provide it if asked to. This makes it technically impossible to officially license those specific Versions under LGPL, but I still consider them Free to use for other purposes under the same terms GT6 has.
